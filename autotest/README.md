## Directory microMathematics/autotest

This directory contains some useful scripts used to automatically test the microMathematics Plus.

*create-avd.sh* - can be used in order to create necessary Android Virtual Devices (AVDs).

*run-session.sh* - main script that runs a test session using all emulators previously created by create-avd.sh.

Usage:
```
# ./run-session.sh ../release/microMathematics_<version>.apk
```

*run-emulator.sh* - helper script

Note: it is possible, that additionally to Android SDK, the android tools are also installed in the machine. 
In this case, the version of the */usr/bin/adb* executable shall be the same as in *ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb*
To ensure it, run:
```
# /usr/bin/adb version
# ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb version
```
If versions are different, exchange the file */usr/bin/adb* by *ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb*.
